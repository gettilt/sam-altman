    "explanation": "When someone is on a hot streak you give them the ball. In Sam Altman's case he is on one of the hottest capital building streaks of our lifetime, let's get him capital. Not only is everything he touches (openAI, Stripe, Y Combinator) winning, but he is using his power at openAI for dealmaking with his larger investments. Reddit (Sam is one of largest shareholders) has secured a deal to sell it's data to openAI and Helion (Nuclear company that received $375mm from Sam's VC) managed to secure a deal with Microsoft (openAI investor). There are many more deals to be done for the Sam Altman affiliated companies that get loopt into his hot streak. ",
